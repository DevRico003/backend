# Trunk-based Development Workflow

[Source](https://codeburst.io/trunk-based-development-vs-git-flow-a0212a6cae64)

* In the trunk-based development model, all developers work on a single branch with open access to it. Often it's simply the master branch. They commit code to it and run it. 

* They also can create a short-lived feature branches. Once code on their branch compiles and passes all tests, they merge it straight to `master`. 

**Note:** The only way to review the code is to do full code review. Developers that work in such style should be experienced so that you know they won't lower source code quality.
